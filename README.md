# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
I create this repository to submit for the peer grade assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. Dataset and files to run project are described as the followings:
## Dataset
1) The data for the project can be downloaded from the link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.n/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2) Descriptions about the data can be found from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Files
1) CodeBook.md describes variables and work that I implement to process the data.
2) The file run_analysis.R performs analysis of the data and follows the steps which are required from the course project:
  a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  e) From the data set in d), creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3) TidyData.txt is the final data after perform all above squences.
